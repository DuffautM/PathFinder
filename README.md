# PathFinder

## Purpose

The innovation project is a third year project.
We had to find an innovating idea and make a prototype of it with a documentation and an explanation of the tests.

## Our idea

### Concept

After a long search, we finally found the Pathfinder concept.
A beacon is placed, it transmit a message with his location to a bracelet own by a user.
This bracelet have a screen wich indicate the direction of the beacon with an arrow.
Then the user can simply walk to it.

### Use case

Person have a walk in the forest or mountain. With Pathfinder, they can have the location of points of view.<br\>
A fire has started in a building, an employee can simply go outside of the building with the Pathfinder indicator.
